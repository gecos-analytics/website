# Political risk assessment

Gecos Analytics risk assessment maps the political risk inherent in your
organization's operations. Unfortunately most organizations in Europe are
dependent on services provided by Unites States-based megacorporations such as
Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google. These corporations succumb easily to
political control by the authoritarian U.S. executive branch.

Risk assessment also takes into other key players, mainly The People's Republic
of China. The China-risk is mostly about high-tech hardware and components.
